so basically this vector data is primarily used in large nlms and various types of language models to identify the correct word embeddings for the user in which that he could be able to identify the what type of output that can be given by the models so that's what it is all about so here you can see embedded models so embedded models in the sense the word to vector and any kind of natural resources in which convert words into vectors so these vectors can be identified or this can be like how to say for every input sentence for example if a person give this is the cat is an animal for this animal could be like humans can also be called as animal right here humans are also an animal that is also here the vectors could be saved in such a way that the vectors can be given as 0.7 something something
